### Benchmark Considerations

Comparing 0.9 of one compression algorithm with 0.9 of another is comparing apples and oranges. You want to pick _some_ numbers A and B at which the output has a comparable quality look. E.g. 0.9 for Appleâ€™s JPEG might be equivalent to 0.8 for their HEIF. - [Daniel Eggert](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt/status/1062862148500512768)
